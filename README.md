# DeveloperPDFs

An app to create developer bios, in pdf format, based on their GitHub user name.

When the app runs, the user is prompted for their GitHub user name.  The app takes that input, makes a call to GitHub, then renders the required data on a dynamically created HTML page.  That page is then exported as a pdf.
